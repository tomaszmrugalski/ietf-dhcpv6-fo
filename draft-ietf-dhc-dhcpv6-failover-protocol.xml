    <abstract>
      <t>DHCPv6 defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/> does not offer
      server redundancy. This document defines a specific protocol
      implementation to provide for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for 
      running two servers on the same network with capability 
      for either server to take over clients' leases in case of server failure or network partition.  
      This is the third in a series of documents documenting 
      DHCPv6 Failover.
      DHCPv6 failover requirements are
      specified in <xref target="RFC7031"/>.  
      Design considerations are documented in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design"/>.
      One could implement the DHCPv6 Failover protocol by
      referring only to the current document and not the design document,
      as the current document explains the details of the protocol.  
      However, the
      design document explains "why" the protocol operates as
      it does, making it required reading for someone implementing the
      failover protocol described in this document.

      <list style="symbols">

        <t>auto-partner-down - a capability where a failover server
	will move from COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state to 
	PARTNER-DOWN state automatically, without operator intervention.</t>

	<t>DDNS - Dynamic DNS.  Typically used as an acronym referring to
	dynamic update of the DNS.</t> 

	<t>Failover endpoint - The failover protocol allows for
	there to be a unique failover 'endpoint' for each failover
	relationship in which a failover server participates.  The
	failover relationship is defined by a relationship name,
	and includes the failover partner IP address, the role this
	server takes with respect to that partner (primary or
	secondary), and the prefixes associated with that relationship.
	Note that a single prefix can only be associated with a
	single failover relationship.  This failover endpoint can
	take actions and hold unique states.  Typically, there is
	one failover endpoint per partner (server), although there
	may be more.  'Server' and 'failover endpoint' are synonymous
	only if the server participates in only one failover
	relationship. However, for the sake of simplicity 'Server'
	is used throughout the document to refer to a failover
	endpoint unless to do so would be confusing.</t>

        <t>Failover communication - all messages exchanged between
        partners.</t>

        <t>Independent Allocation - an allocation algorithm
        that splits the available pool of resources between the primary
        and secondary servers that is particularly well suited for
        vast pools (i.e. when available resources are not expected
        to deplete). 
	See <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design"/>
	for details.
	</t>

	<t>Lease - an association of a DHCPv6 client with an IPv6 
	address or delegated prefix.</t>

        <t>Partner - name of the other DHCPv6 server that participates
        in failover relationship. When the role (primary or secondary)
        is not important, the other server is referred to as a "failover
        partner" or simply partner.</t>

        <t>Primary Server - First out of two DHCPv6 servers that participate
        in a failover relationship. In active-passive mode this is the
        server that handles most of the client traffic. Its failover partner
        is referred to as secondary server. </t>

        <t>Proportional Allocation - an allocation algorithm
        that splits the available resources between
        the primary and secondary servers and maintains proportions between
	available resources on both. It is particularly well suited for more
        limited resources.  
	See <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design"/>
	for details.
	</t>

	<t>Resource - Any type of resource that is managed by
	DHCPv6. Currently there are three types of such resources
	defined: a non-temporary IPv6 address, a temporary IPv6 address,	 
	and an IPv6 prefix. Other resource types may
	be defined in the future.</t>

        <t>Responsive - A server that is responsive, will respond to
        DHCPv6 client requests.</t>

        <t>Secondary Server - Second of two DHCPv6 servers that participate
        in a failover relationship. Its failover partner is referred to as
        the primary server. In active-passive mode this server (the secondary)
	typically does not handle client traffic and acts as a backup.</t>

        <t>Server - A DHCPv6 server that implements DHCPv6 failover.
        'Server' and 'failover endpoint' are synonymous only if the
        server participates in only one failover relationship. </t>

        <t>Unresponsive - A server that is unresponsive will not
        respond to DHCPv6 client requests.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>The failover protocol provides a means for cooperating
      DHCPv6 servers to work together to provide a DHCPv6 service
      with availability that is increased beyond that which could
      be provided by a single DHCPv6 server operating alone.  It
      is designed to protect DHCPv6 clients against server unreachability,
      including server failure and network partition. It is possible
      to deploy exactly two servers that are able to continue
      providing a lease on an IPv6 address <xref target="RFC3315"/>
      or on an IPv6 prefix <xref target="RFC3633"/>
      without the DHCPv6 client experiencing lease expiration or a
      reassignment of a lease to a different IPv6 address (or prefix) 
      in the event of failure by one or the other of the two servers.</t>

      <t>This protocol defines active-passive mode, sometimes also
      called a hot standby model. This means that during normal
      operation one server is active (i.e. actively responds to
      clients' requests) while the second is passive (i.e. it 
      receives clients' requests, but does not respond to them and only
      maintains a copy on the binding database and is ready to take over
      incoming queries in case of primary server
      failure). Active-active mode (i.e. both servers actively
      handling clients' requests) is currently not supported for the
      sake of simplicity. Such a mode is likely to be defined as an
      extension at a later time and will probably be based on <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-load-balancing" />.</t>

      <t>The failover protocol is designed to provide lease stability
      for leases with lease times beyond a short period.  Due in part to the
      additional overhead required as well as requirements to handle
      time skew between failover partners 
      (See <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design"/>)
      failover is not suitable for leases shorter than 30 seconds. 
      The DHCPv6 Failover protocol MUST NOT be used for leases shorter 
      than 30 seconds.</t>

      <t>This protocol attempts to fulfill all DHCPv6 failover requirements
      defined in <xref target="RFC7031"/> as well as following the design
      approach documented in 
      <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design"/>.

  <section anchor="msg-framing" title="Message Framing for TCP">

    <t>
    Failover
    communication is conducted over a TCP connection established between the
    partners. The protocol reuses the framing format specified in Section 5.1 of
    <xref target="RFC5460">DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery</xref>, but uses different
    message types with a different message format, described in 
    <xref target="msg-format"/>.  
    All information is sent over the connection as typical
    DHCPv6 messages that convey DHCPv6 options, following the format defined in
    Section 22.1 of <xref target="RFC3315"/>.

<section title="Connection Management">
  <section anchor="create-connections" title="Creating Connections">
    <t>Every primary server implementing the failover protocol
    MUST attempt to connect to all of its partners periodically,
    where the period is implementation dependent and SHOULD be
    configurable.  In the event that a connection has been rejected
    by a CONNECTACK message with a reject-reason option contained
    in it or a DISCONNECT message, a server SHOULD reduce the
    frequency with which it attempts to connect to that server but
    it MUST continue to attempt to connect periodically.</t>

    <t>Every secondary server implementing the failover protocol
    MUST listen for connection attempts from the primary server.
    </t>

    <t>When a primary server successfully creates a TCP connection
    with a secondary server, it SHOULD attempt to negotiate a TLS
    <xref target="RFC5246"/>connection over the newly created TCP
    connection, as described in Section 8.2 of
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-active-leasequery"/>.
    In the language of that section, the primary failover server
    operates as the "requestor" and the secondary failover server
    operates as the "DHCPv6 server".</t>

    <t>If a TLS connection is not negotiated, either server MAY
    choose to continue to establish a failover relationship or
    it MAY choose to refuse to proceed without a TLS connection.
    </t>

    <t>When a connection attempt succeeds, the primary server which
    has initiated the connection attempt MUST send a CONNECT message
    down the connection.  </t>

    <t>When a connection attempt is received by a secondary server, the only information
    that the secondary server has is the IP address of the partner
    initiating a connection.  If it has any relationships with the
    connecting server for which it is a secondary server, it should
    just await the CONNECT message or a STARTTLS message (see Section
    8.2 of
    <xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-active-leasequery"/>).
    Once it has received the CONNECT message, it will use the information
    in that message to determine which relationship this connection
    is to service.</t>
    
    <t>If it has no secondary relationships with the connecting
    server, it MUST drop the connection.  The goal is to limit
    the resources expended dealing with attempts to create a spurious
    failover connection.</t>

    <t>To summarize -- a primary server MUST use a connection that it has
    initiated in order to send a CONNECT message.  Every server that
    is a secondary server in a relationship MUST listen for CONNECT
    messages from the primary server.</t>

    <t>Once a connection is established, the primary server MUST send
    a CONNECT message across the connection.  A secondary server MUST
    wait for the CONNECT message from a primary server.  If the
    secondary server doesn't receive a CONNECT message from the
    primary server in an installation dependent amount of time, it MAY
    drop the connection.</t>

    <t>The secondary server responds to the CONNECT message with a
    CONNECTACK message indicating its response to request for a connection
    contained in the CONNECT message.</t>

    <t>When the CONNECT and CONNECTACK exchange successfully produces a
    working failover connection, the next message sent over a new connection 
    is a STATE message.  Upon the receipt of this message, the receiver can consider
    communications ok.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Endpoint Identification">
     <t>A failover endpoint is always associated with a set
    of DHCPv6 prefixes that are configured on the DHCPv6 server where
    the endpoint appears.  A DHCPv6 prefix MUST NOT be associated with
    more than one failover endpoint.</t>

    <t>The failover protocol SHOULD be configured with one failover
    relationship between each pair of failover servers. In this
    case there is one failover endpoint for that relationship on
    each failover partner.  This failover relationship MUST have a
    unique name.</t>

    <t>Any failover endpoint can take actions and hold unique states.</t>

    <t>This document frequently describes the behavior of the protocol in
    terms of primary and secondary servers, not primary and secondary
    failover endpoints.  However, it is important to remember that every
    'server' described in this document is in reality a failover endpoint
    that resides in a particular process, and that several failover
    end-points may reside in the same server process.</t>

    <t>It is not the case that there is a unique failover endpoint
    for each prefix that participates in a failover relationship.
    On one server, there is (typically) one failover endpoint per
    partner, regardless of how many prefixes are managed by that
    combination of partner and role.  On a particular server, any
    given prefix that participates in failover will be associated
    with exactly one failover endpoint.</t>

    <t>When a connection is received from the partner, the unique failover
    endpoint to which the message is directed is determined solely by
    the IP address of the partner, the relationship-name, and the role
    of the receiving server.</t>

 </section>


  <section anchor="processing-binding-updates" title="Processing Binding Updates">

     <t>When a BNDUPD is received each OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option
     is processed separately, and each must be independently
     accepted or rejected.</t>

      <t>When analyzing an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option from a partner server, if
      there is insufficient information in the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA to process
      it, then reject the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA with "MissingBindingInformation".</t>

      <t>The server receiving a BNDUPD update from its partner must
      evaluate the received information in each OPTION_CLIENT_DATA
      option to see if it is consistent with already known state
      and decide which information - the previously known or that
      just received - is "better".  If the information in the BNDUPD
      is "better", the receiving server will accept the information
      in the BNDUPD.  If the information in the server's binding
      database is "better", the server will reject the information
      in the BNDUPD.</t>

   <t>A server receving a BNDUPD message MUST respond to the sender of that
      message with a BNDACK message which contains the same xid as the
      BNDUPD message.  This BNDACK message MUST contain one
      or more
      OPTION_CLIENT_DATA options, each of which corresponds to 
      one of the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA options in the BNDUPD message.</t>

     <t>Each OPTION_CLIENT_DATA in the BNDACK which is accepted SHOULD
     NOT contain an OPTION_STATUS_CODE unless a status message
     needs to be sent to the failover partner, in which case it
     SHOULD include an OPTION_STATUS_CODE option with a status
     code indicating success and whatever message is needed.
     </t>

     <t>To indicate rejection of the information
     in an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA, an OPTION_STATUS_CODE SHOULD be
     included with a status code indicating an error, in the
     OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option in the BNDACK message.</t>

 </section>

  <section anchor="accept-or-reject" title="Accept or Reject?">

     <t>The first task in processing the information in an
     OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option is extract the client information
     and resource information out of the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option,
     and to access the resource (IP address or prefix) information
     in the server's binding database.</t>

      <t>If the resource specified in the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA is not
      a resource associated with the failover endpoint which received
      the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option, then reject it with reject-reason
      "ConfigurationConflict".</t>

      <t>In general, acceptance or rejection is based around the
      comparison of two different time values, one from the
      OPTION_CLIENT_DATA and one from receiving server's binding
      database associated with the resource found in the
      OPTION_CLIENT_DATA.  The time for the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA is
      the OPTION_CLT_TIME if one appears, and the
      OPTION_F_START_TIME_OF_STATE if one does not.  The time for
      the resource in the server's binding database is the
      client-last-transaction-time, if one appears, and the
      start-time-of-state if one does not.</t>

      <t>The basic approach is to compare these times, and if the
      one from the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA is clearly later, then accept
      the information in the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA.  If the one from
      the server's binding database is clearly later, then reject
      the information in the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA.  The challenge
      comes when they are essentially the same (i.e., +/- 5 seconds).
      The table below (<xref target="tbl-conflict-resolution"/>)
      contains the rules for dealing with these situations.

    <t>time(1): If the time value in the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA is later than

    state-expiration-time, accept it, else reject it.</t>

    <t>time(3): If the OPTION_CLT_TIME value in the OPTION_CLIENT_DATA is later than
    the start-time-of-state in the receiving server's binding, accept it, else
    reject it.</t>

    <t>(1,2,3): If rejecting, use reject reason "OutdatedBindingInformation".</t>

    <t>(4): If the client in an OPTION_CLIENT_DATA option and in a receiving server's
    binding differ, then if the receiving server is a secondary accept it, else
    reject it with a reject reason of "AddressInUseByOtherClient".</t>

      <t>The lease update may be accepted or rejected.  Rejection
      SHOULD NOT change the flag in a lease that says that it should
      be transmitted to the failover partner.  If this flag is set,
      then it should be transmitted, but if it is not already set,
      the rejection of a lease state update SHOULD NOT trigger an
      automatic update of the failover partner sending the rejected
      update.  The potential for update storms is too great, and
      in the unusual case where the servers simply can't agree,
      that disagreement is better than an update storm.  </t>

    <!-- <t>Discussion: There will definitely be different types of update
      rejections. For example, this will allow a server to treat differently a
      case when receiving a new lease that it previously haven't seen than a
      case when partner sents old version of a lease for which a newer state is
      known.</t>-->

      required to unambiguously identify the BNDUPD that triggered the BNDACK.</t>

    <!-- issue 4 
    TODO: Describe controlled re-allocation of released/expired
    leases to different clients.

    Done 10/16/12 Kim
    -->
    <!-- see section 5.2.2 in v4 failover -->

    <t>When in PARTNER-DOWN state there is a waiting period after
    which a resource can be re-allocated to another client.  For
    resources which are available when the server enters PARTNER-DOWN
    state, the period is the MCLT from the entry into PARTNER-DOWN
    state.  For resources which are not available when the server
    enters PARTNER-DOWN state, the period is the MCLT after the
    later of the following times: the failover-partner-lifetime, the
    next-partner-lifetime (if any), and the failover-expire-time.
    If this time would be earlier than the current time
    plus the MCLT, then the time the server entered PARTNER-DOWN
    state plus the maximum-client-lead-time is used.</t>

    <!-- I don't think we want to discuss these paragraphs from the
     v4 draft.  Experience shows that nobody wants to live with MCLT
     restrictions in PARTNER-DOWN state.

    Two options exist for lease times given out while in PARTNER-DOWN
    state, with different ramifications flowing from each.

    If the server wishes the Failover protocol to protect it from loss of
    stable storage in PARTNER-DOWN state, then it should ensure that the
    MCLT based lease time restrictions in section 5.1 are maintained,
    even in PARTNER-DOWN state.

    If the server wishes to forego the protection of the Failover proto-
    col in the event of loss of stable storage, then it need recognize no
    restrictions on actual client lease times while in PARTNER-DOWN
    state.

    -->

    <t>In any other state, a server cannot reallocate a resource from one
    client to another without first notifying its partner (through a
    BNDUPD message) and receiving acknowledgement (through a BNDACK message) 
    that its partner is aware that that first client is not using
    the resource.</t>

    <t>This may be modeled in the following way.</t>

    <t>An "available" resource on a server may be allocated to any client.
    A resource which was leased to a client and which expired or was
    released by that client would take on a new state, EXPIRED or
    RELEASED respectively.  The partner server would then be notified
    that this resource was EXPIRED or RELEASED through a BNDUPD.  When
    the sending server received the BNDACK for that resource showing it
    was FREE, it would move the resource from EXPIRED or RELEASED to
    FREE, and it would be available for allocation by the primary server
    to any clients.</t>

    <t>A server MAY reallocate a resource in the EXPIRED or RELEASED
    state to the same client with no restrictions provided it has not
    sent a BNDUPD message to its partner.  This situation would exist if
    the lease expired or was released after the transition into
    PARTNER-DOWN state, for instance.</t>

  <section anchor="states" title="Endpoint States">
    <section anchor="state-machine-operation" title="State Machine Operation">

      <t>Each server (or, more accurately, failover endpoint) can take
      on a variety of failover states.  These states play a crucial role
      in determining the actions that a server will perform when
      processing a request from a DHCPv6 client as well as dealing with
      changing external conditions (e.g., loss of connection to a failover
      partner).</t>

      <t> The failover state in which a server is running controls the following
      behaviors: </t>
        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>Responsiveness -- the server is either responsive to DHCPv6
          client requests or it is not.</t>

          <t>Allocation Pool -- which pool of addresses (or prefixes) can be
          used for advertisement on receipt of a SOLICIT or allocation on receipt
	  of a REQUEST message.</t>

          <t>MCLT -- ensure that valid lifetimes are not beyond what the partner
          has acked plus the MCLT (or not).</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>A server will transition from one failover state to another based
      on the specific values held by the following state variables:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">

          <t>Current failover state.</t>

          <t>Communications status (OK or not OK).</t>

          <t>Partner's failover state (if known).</t>

        </list></t>

      <t>Whenever any of the above state variables
      changes state, the state machine is invoked, which may then trigger a
      change in the current failover state.  Thus, whenever the communications
      status changes, the state machine processing is invoked.  This may or
      may not result in a change in the current failover state.</t>

      <t>Whenever a server transitions to a new failover state, the new state
      MUST be communicated to its failover partner in a STATE message if the
      communications status is OK.  In addition, whenever a server makes a
      transition into a new state, it MUST record the new state, its current
      understanding of its partner's state, and the time at which it entered the
      new state in stable storage.</t>

      <t>The following state transition diagram gives a condensed view of the
      state machine.  If there is a difference between the words describing a
      particular state and the diagram below, the words should be considered
      authoritative.</t>

      <t>In the diagram below, the word (responsive) or (unresponsive) appers
      in the states, and refers to whether the server in this state is allowed
      to respond to client DHCP requests.</t>

      <t>In the state transition diagram below, the "+" or "-" in the upper
      right corner of each state is a notation about whether communication is
      ongoing with the other server.

      ends on a new page -->

    <section anchor="state-startup" title="STARTUP State">

      <t>The STARTUP state affords an opportunity for a server to
      probe its partner server, before starting to service DHCP
      clients.  When in the STARTUP state, a server attempts to
      learn its partner's state and determine (using that information
      if it is available) what state it should enter.</t>

      <t>The STARTUP state is not shown with any specific state
      transitions in the <xref target="endpoint-state-machine">state machine
      diagram</xref> because the processing during the STARTUP state
      can cause the server to transition to any of the other states,
      so that specific state transition arcs would only obscure
      other information.</t>

      <section anchor="operation-in-startup-state" title="Operation in STARTUP State">

        <t>The server MUST NOT be responsive to DHCPv6 clients in STARTUP state.</t>

        <t>Whenever a STATE message is sent to the partner while
        in STARTUP state the STARTUP flag MUST be set in the message
        and the previously recorded failover state MUST be placed
        in the server-state option.</t>

      </section> <!-- operation-in-startup-state -->

      <section anchor="transition-out-of-startup-state" title="Transition Out of STARTUP State">

        <t>The following algorithm is followed every time the
        server initializes itself, and enters STARTUP state.</t>

        <t>Step 1:</t>

        <t>If there is any record in stable storage of a previous
        failover state for this server, set PREVIOUS-STATE to the
        last recorded value in stable storage, and go to Step 2.</t>

        <t>If there is no record of any previous failover state in
        stable storage for this server, then set the PREVIOUS-STATE
        to RECOVER and set the TIME-OF-FAILURE to 0.  This will
        allow two servers which already have lease information to
        synchronize themselves prior to operating.</t>

        <t>In some cases, an existing server will be commissioned
        as a failover server and brought back into operation where
        its partner is not yet available.  In this case, the newly
        commissioned failover server will not operate until its
        partner comes online  -- but it has operational responsibilities
        as a DHCP server nonetheless.  To properly handle this
        situation, a server SHOULD be configurable in such a way
        as to move directly into PARTNER-DOWN state after the startup
        period expires if it has been unable to contact its partner
        during the startup period.</t>

        <t>Step 2:</t>

	<t>Implementations will differ in the ways that they deal
	with the state machine for failover endpoint states.  In
	many cases, state transitions will occur when communications
	goes from "OK" to failed, or from failed to "OK", and some
	implementations will implement a portion of their state
	machine processing based on these changes.</t>
	
	<t>In these cases, during startup, if the previous state
	is one where communications was "OK", then set the previous
	state to the state that is the result of the communications
	failed state transition when in that state (if such transition
	exists -- some states don't have a communications failed
	state transition, since they allow both communications OK
	and failed).</t>

        <t>Step 3:</t>

        <t>Start the STARTUP state timer.  The time that a server
        remains in the STARTUP state (absent any communications
        with its partner) is implementation dependent but SHOULD
        be short.  It SHOULD be long enough for a TCP connection
        to be created to a heavily loaded partner across a slow
        network.</t>

        <t>Step 4:</t>

	<t>If the server is a primary server: attempt to create a 
	   TCP connection to the failover partner.  If the server is
	   a secondary server, listen on the failover port and wait
	   for the primary server to connect.  See 
	   <xref target="create-connections"/>.</t>  

        <t>Step 5:</t>

        <t>Wait for "communications OK".</t>

        <t>When and if communications become "OK", clear the STARTUP
        flag, and set the current state to the PREVIOUS-STATE.</t>

        <t>If the partner is in PARTNER-DOWN state, and if the time
        at which it entered PARTNER-DOWN state (as received in the
        start-time-of-state option in the STATE message) is later
        than the last recorded time of operation of this server,
        then set CURRENT-STATE to RECOVER.  If the time at which
        it entered PARTNER-DOWN state is earlier than the last
        recorded time of operation of this server, then set
        CURRENT-STATE to POTENTIAL-CONFLICT.</t>

        <t>Then, transition to the current state and take the
        "communications OK" state transition based on the current
        state of this server and the partner.</t>

        <t>Step 6:</t>

	<t>If the startup time expires prior to communications 
	   becoming "OK", the server SHOULD transition
        to the PREVIOUS-STATE.</t>

    <t>PARTNER-DOWN state is a state either server can enter.  When
    in this state, the server assumes that it is the only server
    operating and serving the client base. If one server is in
    PARTNER-DOWN state, the other server MUST NOT be operating.</t>

    <t>A server can enter PARTNER-DOWN state either as a result of 
    operator intervention (when an operator determines that the server's
    partner is, indeed, down), or as a result of an optional auto-partner-down
    capability where PARTNER-DOWN state is entered automatically after
    a server has been in COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state for a pre-determined
    period of time.</t>

      <section anchor="operation-in-partner-down-state" title="Operation in PARTNER-DOWN State">

        <t>The server MUST be responsive in PARTNER-DOWN state, regardless
	if it is primary or secondary.</t>

        <t>It will allow renewal of all outstanding leases on resources.
        For those resources for which the server is
        using proportional allocation (i.e. prefixes), it will allocate resources
        from its own pool, and after a fixed period of time (the
        MCLT interval) has elapsed from entry into PARTNER-DOWN
        state, it may allocate IP addresses from the set of all
        available pools. Server SHOULD fully deplete its own pool,
	before starting allocations from its downed partner's pool.</t>

        <t>Any resource tagged as available for allocation by the
        other server (at entry to PARTNER-DOWN state) MUST NOT be
        allocated to a new client until the MCLT
        beyond the entry into PARTNER-DOWN state has elapsed.</t>

        <t>A server in PARTNER-DOWN state MUST NOT allocate a resource
        to a DHCP client different from that to which it was
        allocated at the entrance to PARTNER-DOWN state until the
        MCLT beyond the maximum of the following
        times: client expiration time, most recently transmitted
        potential-expiration-time, most recently received ack of
        potential-expiration-time from the partner, and most recently
        acked potential-expiration-time to the partner.  <!-- tomek:

        See section 7.1.5 for details. --> If this time would be earlier
        than the current time plus the maximum-client-lead-time, then
        the time the server entered PARTNER-DOWN state plus the
        maximum-client-lead-time is used.</t>

        <t>The server is not restricted by the MCLT when offering
        lease times while in PARTNER-DOWN state.</t>

        <t>In the unlikely case when there are two servers operating
        in a PARTNER-DOWN state, there is a chance of duplicate leases
	for the same prefix to be
        assigned. This leads to a POTENTIAL-CONFLICT (unresponsive)
        state when they re-establish contact. The duplicate lease
        issue can be postponed to a large extent by the server granting
        new leases first from its own pool. Therefore the server operating
        in PARTNER-DOWN state MUST use its own pool first for new
        leases before assigning any leases from its downed partner pool.

        <t>If at any time while a server is in RECOVER state

      that it has received all outstanding binding update information.
      In the RECOVER-WAIT state the server will wait for the MCLT
      in order to ensure that any processing that this server might
      have done prior to losing its stable storage will not cause
      future difficulties.</t>

        <t>Upon entry to RECOVER-WAIT state the server MUST start
        a timer whose expiration is set to a time equal to the time
        the server went down (if known) or the time the server
        started (if the down-time is unknown) plus the
        maximum-client-lead-time.  When this timer expires, the
        server will transition into RECOVER-DONE state.</t>

        <t>This is to allow any IP addresses that were allocated
        by this server prior to loss of its client binding information
        in stable storage to contact the other server or to time
        out.</t>

        <t>If this is the first time this server has run failover
        -- as determined by the information received from the
        partner, not necessarily only as determined by this server's
        stable storage (as that may have been lost), then the waiting
        time discussed above may be skipped, and the server MAY
        transition immediately to RECOVER-DONE state.</t>

        <t>If the server has never before run failover, then there
        is no need to wait in this state -- but, again, to determine
        if this server has run failover it is vital that the
        information provided by the partner be utilized, since the
        stable storage of this server may have been lost.</t>

        <t>If communications fails while a server is in RECOVER-WAIT
        state, it has no effect on the operation of this state.
        The server SHOULD continue to operate its timer, and if the
        timer expires during the period where communications with
        the other server have failed, then the server SHOULD
        transition to RECOVER-DONE state.  This is rare -- failover
        state transitions are not usually made while communications
        are interrupted, but in this case there is no reason to
        inhibit the timer.</t>

        <t hangText="Lease time calculations"> <vspace/>

        As discussed in 
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-failover-design"/>, the
        lease interval given to a DHCP client can never be more than the
        MCLT greater than the most recently received 
	potential-expiration-time from the failover partner or the current time,
        whichever is later.
        <vspace blankLines="1"/>
        As long as a server adheres to this constraint, the specifics of
        the lease interval that it gives to a DHCP client or the value
        of the potential-expiration-time sent to its failover partner
        are implementation dependent.</t>

        <t hangText="Lazy update of partner server"> <vspace/>

        After sending a REPLY that includes a lease update to a client,
        the server servicing a DHCP client request attempts to update
        its partner with the new binding information.</t> 

        <t hangText="Reallocation of resources between clients"> <vspace/>

        Whenever a client binding is released or expires, a BNDUPD
        message must be sent to the partner, setting the binding
        state to RELEASED or EXPIRED.  However, until a BNDACK is
        received for this message, the resource cannot be allocated
        to another client.  It cannot be allocated to the same client
        again if a BNDUPD was sent, otherwise it can. See <xref
        target="reallocation"/> for details.
        </t>
      </list>
      </t>

      <t>In NORMAL state, each server receives binding updates from
      its partner server in BNDUPD messages. It records these in its
      binding database in stable storage and then sends a
      corresponding BNDACK message to its partner server.</t>

        <t>If an external command is received by a server in NORMAL
        state informing it that its partner is down, then transition
        into PARTNER- DOWN state.  Generally, this would be an unusual
        situation, where some external agency knew the partner server
        was down prior to the failover server discovering it on its
	own.</t>  
        <!-- Does it make sense? That is at least strange - server maintain
        connection with its parner and suddenly operator states that that

        <t>If a server in NORMAL state fails to receive acks to messages sent to
        its partner for an implementation dependent period of time, it MAY
        move into COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state.  This situation might
        occur if the partner server was capable of maintaining the TCP connection 
	between the server and also capable of sending a CONTACT message 
	periodically, but was (for some reason) incapable of processing 
	BNDUPD messages.</t>

        <t>If a server in NORMAL state receives any messages from its partner

	from there.  For example, it would be expected for the partner
        to transition from POTENTIAL-CONFLICT into NORMAL state, but not for
        the partner to transition from NORMAL into POTENTIAL-CONFLICT state.</t>

      between NORMAL and COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state as the network
      connection between them fails and recovers, or as the partner server
      cycles between operational and non-operational.  No duplicate resource
      allocation can occur while the servers cycle between these
      states.</t>

      <t>When a server enters COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state, if it has been
      configured to support an automatic transition out of COMMUNICATIONS-
      INTERRUPTED state and into PARTNER-DOWN state (i.e., a auto-partner-down
      has been configured), then a timer MUST be started
      for the length of the configured auto-partner-down period.</t>

      <t>A server transitioning into the COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED

        <t>In this state a server MUST respond to all DHCP client
        requests.  When allocating new leases, each server allocates
        from its own pool, where the primary MUST allocate only FREE
        resources, and the secondary MUST
        allocate only FREE_BACKUP resources.  When
        responding to RENEW messages, each server will allow continued
        renewal of a DHCP client's current lease on a resource
        irrespective of whether that lease was given out by the
        receiving server or not, although the renewal period MUST NOT
        exceed the maximum client lead time (MCLT) beyond the latest
        of: 1) the potential valid lifetime already acknowledged by
        the other server, or 2) now, or 3) the potential valid lifetime 
	received from the partner server.</t>

        <t>However, since the server cannot communicate with its
        partner in this state, the acknowledged potential valid
        lifetime will not be updated in any new bindings.  This is
        likely to eventually cause the actual valid lifetimes to
	converge to the MCLT (unless this is greater than
        the desired-client-lease-time).</t>

        <t>If communications fails with the partner while in
        POTENTIAL-CONFLICT state, then the server will transition to
        RESOLUTION-INTERRUPTED state.</t>

        <t>Whenever either server receives an UPDDONE message from its
        partner while in POTENTIAL-CONFLICT state, it MUST transition
        to a new state.  The primary MUST transition to CONFLICT-DONE

        This will cause the primary server to leave POTENTIAL-CONFLICT
        state prior to the secondary, since the primary sends an
        UPDREQ message and receives an UPDDONE before the secondary
        sends an UPDREQ message and receives its UPDDONE message.</t>

        <t>When a secondary server receives an indication that the primary

      Yes, we did:  Tomek said this in some email on Sept 7, 2012:

	I'd like to comment on some decisions made regarding load
	balancing, before someone raises it again. v4 failover
	standardization failed, because the draft was too large and
	there was nobody willing to review it. That's why we try
	to succeed with v6 failover by splitting it to smaller
	chunks. That's why this failover covers the absolute minimum,
	i.e. active-passive only with load balancing being out of
	scope. You may notice that some of the states (RECOVER-DONE
	and CONFLICT-DONE) are really useful only for load balancing.
	We decided to keep them in to make extension to LB much
	simpler - the state machine will be operating in the same
	manner with and without LB. Obviously, there are many folks
	interested in load balancing. We are, too, but we want it
	to be an extension, defined in separate draft.
      
      Tomek: Ok, I've changed the wording slightly to not explicitly
      say that server does load balancing, as it is not officially

  <section anchor="DDNS" title="Dynamic DNS Considerations">

    <t>DHCP servers (and clients) can use DNS Dynamic Updates as
    described in <xref target="RFC2136">RFC 2136</xref> to maintain
    DNS name-mappings as they maintain DHCP leases.  Many different
    administrative models for DHCP-DNS integration are possible.
    Descriptions of several of these models, and guidelines that
    DHCP servers and clients should follow in carrying them out,
    are laid out in <xref target="RFC4704">RFC 4704</xref>.</t>

    <t>The nature of the failover protocol introduces some issues
    concerning dynamic DNS (DDNS) updates that are not part of non-failover
    environments.  This section describes these issues, and defines
    the information which failover partners should exchange in order
    to ensure consistent behavior.  The presence of this section
    should not be interpreted as requiring an implementation of
    the DHCPv6 failover protocol to also support DDNS updates.</t>

    <t>The purpose of this discussion is to clarify the areas where
    the failover and DHCP-DDNS protocols intersect for the benefit
    of implementations which support both protocols, not to introduce
    a new requirement into the DHCPv6 failover protocol.  Thus, a
    DHCPv6 server which implements the failover protocol MAY also
    support dynamic DNS updates, but if it does support dynamic DNS
    updates it SHOULD utilize the techniques described here in order
    to correctly distribute them between the failover partners.
    See <xref target="RFC4704">RFC 4704</xref> as well as <xref
    target="RFC4703">RFC 4703</xref> for information on how DHCPv6
    servers deal with potential conflicts when updating DNS even
    without failover.</t>

    <t>From the standpoint of the failover protocol, there is no
    reason why a server which is utilizing the DDNS protocol to
    update a DNS server should not be a partner with a server which
    is not utilizing the DDNS protocol to update a DNS server.
    However, a server which is not able to support DDNS or is not
    configured to support DDNS SHOULD output a warning message when
    it receives BNDUPD messages which indicate that its failover
    partner is configured to support the DDNS protocol to update a
    DNS server.  An implementation MAY consider this an error and
    refuse to operate, or it MAY choose to operate anyway, having
    warned the administrator of the problem in some way.</t>

    <section anchor="failover-ddns"
       title="Relationship between failover and dynamic DNS update">

	<t>The failover protocol describes the conditions under
	which each failover server may renew a lease to its current
	DHCP client, and describes the conditions under which it
	may grant a lease to a new DHCP client.  An analogous set
	of conditions determines when a failover server should
	initiate a DDNS update, and when it should attempt to remove
	records from the DNS. The failover protocol's conditions
	are based on the desired external behavior: avoiding duplicate
	address and prefix assignments; allowing clients to continue
	using leases which they obtained from one failover partner
	even if they can only communicate with the other partner;
	allowing the secondary DHCP server to grant new leases even
	if it is unable to communicate with the primary server.
	The desired external DDNS behavior for DHCP failover servers
	is similar to that described above for the failover protocol
	itself:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	    <t>Allow timely DDNS updates from the server which
	    grants a lease to a client. Recognize that there is
	    often a DDNS update lifecycle which parallels the DHCP
	    lease lifecycle. This is likely to include the addition
	    of records when the lease is granted, and the removal
	    of DNS records when the leased resource is subsequently
	    made available for allocation to a different client.</t>

	    <t>Communicate enough information between the two
	    failover servers to allow one to complete the DDNS
	    update 'lifecycle' even if the other server originally
	    granted the lease.</t>

	    <t>Avoid redundant or overlapping DDNS updates, where
	    both failover servers are attempting to perform DDNS
	    updates for the same lease-client binding.</t>
	    
	    <t>Avoid situations where one partner is attempting to
	    add RRs related to a lease binding while the other
	    partner is attempting to remove RRs related to the same
	    lease binding.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>While DHCP servers configured for DDNS typically perform
	these operations on both the AAAA and the PTR resource records, 
	this is not required.  It is entirely possible that a DHCP server
	could be configured to only update the DNS with PTR records, and 
	the DHCPv6 clients could be responsible for updating the DNS with
	their own AAAA records.  In this case, the discussions here would
	apply only to the PTR records.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="useofddns" 
       title="Exchanging DDNS Information">

	<t>In order for either server to be able to complete a DDNS
	update, or to remove DNS records which were added by its
	partner, both servers need to know the FQDN associated with
	the lease-client binding.  In addition, to properly handle
	DDNS updates, additional information is required.  All of
	the following information needs to be transmitted between
	the failover partners:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	    <t>The FQDN that the client requested be associated
	    with the resource.  If the client doesn't request a
	    particular FQDN and one is synthesized by the failover
	    server or if the failover server is configured to replace
	    a client requested FQDN with a different FQDN, then
	    the server generated value would be used. </t>

	    <t>The FQDN that was actually placed in the DNS for
	    this lease. It may differ from the client requested
	    FQDN due to some form of disambiguation or other DHCP
	    server configuration (as described above).</t>
	    
	    <t>The status of and DDNS operations in progress or
	    completed.</t>

	    <t>Information sufficient to allow the failover partner
	    to remove the FQDN from the DNS should that become
	    necessary.</t>
	</list></t>

	<t>These data items are the minimum necessary set to reliably
	allow two failover partners to successfully share the
	responsibility to keep the DNS up to date with the resources
	allocated to clients.</t>

	<t>This information would typically be included in BNDUPD
	messages sent from one failover partner to the other.
	Failover servers MAY choose not to include this information
	in BNDUPD messages if there has been no change in the status
	of any DDNS update related to the lease.</t>

	<t>The partner server receiving BNDUPD messages containing
	the DDNS information SHOULD compare the status information
	and the FQDN with the current DDNS information it has
	associated with the lease binding, and update its notion
	of the DDNS status accordingly.</t>

	<t>Some implementations will instead choose to send a BNDUPD
	without waiting for the DDNS update to complete, and then
	will send a second BNDUPD once the DDNS update is complete.
	Other implementations will delay sending the partner a
	BNDUPD until the DDNS update has been acknowledged by the
	DNS server, or until some time-limit has elapsed, in order
	to avoid sending a second BNDUPD.</t>

	<t>The FQDN option contains the FQDN that will be associated
	with the AAAA RR (if the server is performing an AAAA RR update
	for the client).  The PTR RR can be generated automatically from
	the IP address or prefix value. The FQDN may be composed
	in any of several ways, depending on server configuration
	and the information provided by the client in its DHCP
	messages. The client may supply a hostname which it would
	like the server to use in forming the FQDN, or it may supply
	the entire FQDN. The server may be configured to attempt
	to use the information the client supplies, it may be
	configured with an FQDN to use for the client, or it may
	be configured to synthesize an FQDN.</t>

	<t>Since the server interacting with the client may not have completed the
	DDNS update at the time it sends the first BNDUPD about the
	lease binding, there may be cases where the FQDN in later
	BNDUPD messages does not match the FQDN included in earlier
	messages.  For example, the responsive server may be
	configured to handle situations where two or more DHCP
	client FQDNs are identical by modifying the most-specific
	label in the FQDNs of some of the clients in an attempt to
	generate unique FQDNs for them (a process sometimes called
	"disambiguation").  Alternatively, at sites which use some
	or all of the information which clients supply to form the
	FQDN, it's possible that a client's configuration may be
	changed so that it begins to supply new data.  The 
	server interacting with the client may react by removing the DNS records which it
	originally added for the client, and replacing them with
	records that refer to the client's new FQDN. In such cases,
	the server SHOULD include the actual FQDN that
	was used in subsequent DDNS options in any BNDUPD messages exchanged between
	the failover partners.  This server
	SHOULD include relevant information in its BNDUPD messages.
	This information may be necessary in order to allow the
	non-responsive partner to detect client configuration changes
	that change the hostname or FQDN data which the client
	includes in its DHCP requests.</t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="addingrr" 
       title="Adding RRs to the DNS">

	<t>A failover server which is going to perform DDNS updates
	SHOULD initiate the DDNS update when it grants a new lease
	to a client. The server which did not grant the lease SHOULD NOT
	initiate
	a DDNS update when it receives the BNDUPD after the lease
	has been granted. The failover protocol ensures that only
	one of the partners will grant a lease to any individual
	client, so it follows that this requirement will prevent
	both partners from initiating updates simultaneously. The
	server initiating the update SHOULD follow the protocol in
	<xref target="RFC4704">RFC 4704</xref>.  The server may be
	configured to perform a AAAA RR update on behalf of its
	clients, or not. Ordinarily, a failover server will not
	initiate DDNS updates when it renews leases. In two cases,
	however, a failover server MAY initiate a DDNS update when
	it renews a lease to its existing client:</t>

	<t><list style="numbers">
	    <t>When the lease was granted before the server was

	    is the server which should initiate the DDNS update.</t>

	    <t>If a server is in PARTNER-DOWN state, it can conclude
	    that its partner is no longer attempting to perform an
	    update for the existing client. If the remaining server
	    has not recorded that an update for the binding has
	    been successfully completed, the server MAY initiate a
	    DDNS update.  It MAY initiate this update immediately
	    upon entry to PARTNER-DOWN state, it may perform this
	    in the background, or it MAY initiate this update upon
	    next hearing from the DHCP client.</t>
	</list></t>

    </section>

    <section anchor="deletingrr" 
       title="Deleting RRs from the DNS">

	<t>The failover server which makes a resource FREE* SHOULD
	initiate any DDNS deletes, if it has recorded that DNS
	records were added on behalf of the client.</t>

	<t>A server not in PARTNER-DOWN state "makes a resource
	FREE" when it initiates a BNDUPD with a binding-status of
	FREE, FREE_BACKUP, EXPIRED, or RELEASED.  Its partner
	confirms this status by acking that BNDUPD, and upon receipt
	of the BNDACK the server has "made the resource FREE".
	Conversely, a server in PARTNER-DOWN state "makes a resource
	FREE" when it sets the binding-status to FREE, since in
	PARTNER-DOWN state no communications is required with the
	partner.</t>

	<t>It is at this point that it should initiate the DDNS
	operations to delete RRs from the DDNS. Its partner SHOULD
	NOT initiate DDNS deletes for DNS records related to the
	lease binding as part of sending the BNDACK message.   The
	partner MAY have issued BNDUPD messages with a binding-status
	of FREE, EXPIRED, or RELEASED previously, but the other
	server will have rejected these BNDUPD messages.</t>

	<t>The failover protocol ensures that only one of the two
	partner servers will be able to make a resource FREE*. The
	server making the resource FREE may be doing so while it
	is in NORMAL communication with its partner, or it may be
	in PARTNER-DOWN state. If a server is in PARTNER-DOWN state,
	it may be performing DDNS deletes for RRs which its partner
	added originally. This allows a single remaining partner
	server to assume responsibility for all of the DDNS activity
	which the two servers were undertaking.</t>

	<t>Another implication of this approach is that no DDNS RR
	deletes will be performed while either server is in
	COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED state, since no resource are
	moved into the FREE* state during that period.</t>

  <!-- RESERVATIONS  
       This isn't really going to work as written, but it is a whole
       lot more complicated than this.  Do we want to even deal with
       this in the draft or just let people work it out?

  <section anchor="reserve" title="Reservations and failover">

    <t>Some DHCP servers support a capability to offer specific preconfigured 
    resources to DHCP clients.  These are real DHCP
    clients, they do the entire DHCP protocol, but these servers always
    offer the client a specific pre-configured resource, and they
    offer that resource to no other clients.  Such a capability has
    several names, but it is sometimes called a "reservation", in that
    the resource is reserved for a particular DHCP client.</t>

    <t>In a situation where there are two DHCP servers serving the same prefix
    without using failover, the two DHCP server's need to have disjoint 
    resource pools, but identical reservations for the DHCP
    clients.</t>

    <t>In a failover context, both servers need to be configured
    with the proper reservations in an identical manner, but if we
    stop there problems can occur around the edge conditions where
    reservations are made for resource that has already been leased
    to a different client.  Different servers handle this conflict
    in different ways, but the goal of the failover protocol is to
    allow correct operation with any server's approach to the normal
    processing of the DHCP protocol.</t>

    <t>The general solution with regards to reservations is as follows.
    Whenever a reserved resource becomes FREE (i.e., when first configured 
    or whenever a client frees it or it expires or is reset), the
    primary server MUST show that resource as FREE (and thus available
    for its own allocation) and it MUST send it to the secondary server
    in a BNDUPD with a flag set showing that it is reserved and with a
    status of FREE_BACKUP.</t>

    <t>Note that this implies that a reserved resource goes through
    the normal state changes from FREE to ACTIVE (and possibly back
    to FREE).  The failover protocol supports this approach to
    reservations, i.e., where the resource undergoes the normal
    state changes of any resource, but it can only be offered to
    the client for which it is reserved.</t>

    <t>From the above, it follows that a reservation solely on the
    secondary will not necessarily allow the secondary to offer
    that address to client to whom it is reserved.  The reservation
    must also appear on the primary as well for the secondary to
    be able to offer the resource to the client to which it is
    reserved.</t>

    <t>When the reservation on a resource is cancelled, if the resource 
    is currently FREE and the server is the primary, or FREE_BACKUP and the
    server is the secondary, the server MUST send a BNDUPD to the other
    server with the binding-status FREE and an indication that the
    resource is no longer reserved.</t>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>DHCPv6 failover is an extension of a standard DHCPv6 protocol, so all
    security considerations from <xref target="RFC3315" />, Section 23 and
    <xref target="RFC3633" />, Section 15 related to the server apply.</t>

    <t>As traffic exchange between clients and server is not encrypted,
    an attacker that penetrated the network and is able to intercept traffic,
    will not gain any additional information by also sniffing communication
    between partners.</t>

    <t>An attacker that is able to impersonate one partner can efficiently
    perform a denial of service attack on the remaining uncompromised server.
    Several techniques may be used: pretending that conflict resolution
    is required, requesting rebalance, claiming that a valid lease was released
    or declined etc. For that reason the communication between servers
    SHOULD support failover connections over TLS, as explained in 
    <xref target="create-connections" />. Such secure connections SHOULD
    be optional and configurable by the administrator.</t>

    <t>A server MUST NOT operate in PARTNER-DOWN if its partner is up.
    Network administrators are expected to switch the remaining active server
    to PARTNER-DOWN state only if they is sure that its partner server
    is indeed down. Failing to obey this requirement will result in both
    servers likely assigning duplicate leases to different clients. Implementers
    should take that into consideration if they decide to implement
    the auto-partner-down timer-based transition to PARTNER-DOWN state.</t>

    <t>Running a network protected by DHCPv6 failover requires more resources
    than running without it. In particular some of the resources are
    allocated to the secondary server and they are not usable in a normal
    (i.e. non failures) operation immediately, though over time they will
    be rebalanced and end up on the server that needs them. While limiting 
    this pool may be preferable from resource utilization perspective, 
    it must be a reasonably large pool, so the secondary may take over once 
    the primary becomes unavailable.</t>
