    <abstract>
      <t>DHCPv6 defined in <xref target="RFC3315"/> does not offer
      server redundancy. This document defines design for DHCPv6
      failover, a mechanism for running two servers on the same
      network with capability for taking over clients' leases in case
      of server failure or network partition. This is a DHCPv6
      Failover design document, it is not protocol specification
      document. It is a second document in a planned series of three
      documents. DHCPv6 failover requirements are specified in <xref
      target="requirements"/>. Protocol specification document will
      follow.</t>

    <section title="Goals">
      <t>Defined failover protocol provides means for protecting
      assigned leases against server unreachability, including server
      failure and network partition. It is possible to deploy exactly
      two servers that are able to continue handling a lease (an IPv6
      address or an IPv6 prefix), without lease expiration or
      a reassignment to a different client.</t>

      <t>This protocol defines active-passive mode, sometimes also
      called hot standby model. This means that during normal
      operation one server is active (i.e. actively responds to
      clients' requests) while the second is passive (i.e. does
      receive clients' requests, but does not respond to them and only
      maintains copy of lease database and it ready to take over
      incoming queries in case of primary server
      failure). Active-active mode (i.e. both servers actively
      handling clients' requests) is currently not supported for the
      sake of simplicity. Such mode may be defined as an exension at a
      later time.</t>
      
      <t>Failover protocol is for designed to provide lease stability for
      reasonably lived leases. Due to additional overhead failover is not
      suitable for leases shorter than 30 seconds. DHCPv6 Failover
      protocol MUST NOT be used for leases shorter than 30 seconds.</t>
      <cref source="tomek">Otherwise we would spawn a nice packet storm
      between partners. Even though 30 seconds it reasonable minimum, we
      may also add something about recommendations. Something like: Lease
      lifetime of at least 30 minutes SHOULD be used if possible.</cref>

      <t>This design attempts to fulfill all DHCPv6 failover requirements
      defined in <xref target="requirements"/>.</t>

      <section title="Additional requirements">
        <t>The following requirements are not related to failover
        mechanism in general, but rather to this particular design.

        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Minimize Asymmetry - while there are two distinct roles
          in failover (primary and secondary server), the idea is that
          differences between those two roles should be as small as
          possible. Two primary reasons are simpler implementation and
          similar hardware utilization (it is envisaged that primary and
          secondary server will be run on a similar hardware).</t>
        </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      
    </section>

<section title="Protocol Overview">

  <t>DHCPv6 Failover Protocol is defined as communication between
  failover partners with all associated algorithms and mechanisms.
  Failover communication is conducted over TCP connection, established
  between partners. It reuses framing format specified in Section 5.1
  of <xref target="RFC5460">DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery</xref>, but does
  not use leasequery message types. Additional failover-specific
  message types are going to be defined. All parameters are sent over
  wire as typical DHCPv6 Options, following format defined in Section
  22.1 of <xref target="RFC3315"/>.</t>

  <t>After initialization, primary server establishes TCP connection
  with its partner. Primary server sends CONNECT message with initial
  parameters. Secondary server responds with CONNECTACK.</t>

  <t>Depending on state in which both partners are, they MUST initiate
  one of the binding update procedures. Each server MAY send UPDREQ
  message to request its partner to send all update has not been sent
  yet (this case applies when partner has existing database and wants
  to update it). Alternatively, server MAY choose to send UPDREQALL to
  request full lease database transmission including all leases (this
  case applies in case of booting up new server after installation,
  corruption or complete loss of database, or other catastrophic
  failure).</t>

  <t>Servers exchange lease information by using BNDUPD message.
  Depending on local and remote state of a lease, server may either
  accept or reject the update. Reception of lease update information
  is confirmed by responding with BNDACK message with appropriate
  status.</t>
  
  <t>A subset of available resources (addresses or prefixes) is
  reserved for secondary server use. That is required for handling a
  case where both servers are able to communicate with clients, but
  unable to communicate with each other. After initial communication
  is established, secondary server requests a pool by sending POOLREQ
  message. Primary server assigns a pool by transmitting POOLRESP
  message. Secondary server may initiate such pool request at any time
  when maintaining communication with primary server.</t>

  <t>Servers use lazy update mechanism to maintain their databases.
  After a server performs any modifications to lease database (assign
  new lease, extend existing one, release or expire), it sends response
  to client first (following "regular" DHCPv6 operation) and then
  informs its partner using BNDUPD message.</t>

  <t>The major problem with lazy update mechanism is case when server
  crashes after sending response to client, but before sending update
  to its partner (or when communication between partners is
  interrupted). To solve this problem, a MCLT mechanism known from
  DHCPv4 failover is reused. An additional configuration parameter
  called Maximum Client Lead Time is introduced. It is the maximum
  amount of time that one server can extend a lease for a client's
  binding beyond the time known by the partner server. See <xref
  target="mclt"/> for detailed desciption how MCLT affects assigned
  lease times.</t>

  <t>Servers verify each others availability by periodically
  exchanging CONTACT messages. See <xref target="reachability"/> for
  discussion about detecting partner's unreachability.</t>
</section>


<section title="Connection Management">

  <section title="Creating Connections">
    <t>Every server implementing the failover protocol SHOULD attempt to
    connect to all of its partners periodically, where the period is
    implementation dependent and SHOULD be configurable.  In the event
    that a connection has been rejected by a CONNECTACK message with a
    reject-reason option contained in it or a DISCONNECT message, a
    server SHOULD reduce the frequency with which it attempts to connect
    to that server but it SHOULD continue to attempt to connect
    periodically.</t>

    <t>When a connection attempt succeeds, if the server generating the
    connection attempt is a primary server for that relationship, then
    it MUST send a CONNECT message down the connection.  If it is not
    a primary server for the relationship, then it MUST just drop the
    connection and wait for the primary server to connect to it.</t>

    <t>When a connection attempt is received, the only information that
    the receiving server has is the IP address of the partner initiating
    a connection.  It also knows whether it has the primary role for
    any failover relationships with the connecting server.  If it has
    any relationships for which it is a primary server, it should
    initiate a connection of its own to the partner server, one for
    each primary relationship it has with that server.</t>
    
    <t>If it has any relationships with the connecting server for which
    it is a seconary server, it should just await the CONNECT message
    to determine which relationship this connection is to serve.</t>

    <t>If it has no secondary relationships with the connecting server, it
    SHOULD drop the connection.</t>

    <t>To summarize -- a primary server MUST use a connection that it has
    initiated in order to send a CONNECT message.  Every server that
    is a secondary server in a relationship attempts to create a
    connection to the server which is primary in the relationship, but
    that connection is only used to stimulate the primary server into
    recognizing that the secondary server is ready for operation.  The
    reason behind this is that the secondary server has no way to
    communicate to the primary server which relationship a connection
    is designed to serve.</t>

    <t>A server which has multiple secondary relationships with a primary
    server SHOULD only send one stimulus connection attempt to the
    primary server.</t>

    <t>Once a connection is established, the primary server MUST send
    a CONNECT message across the connection.  A secondary server MUST
    wait for the CONNECT message from a primary server.  If the
    secondary server doesn't receive a CONNECT message from the
    primary server in an installation dependent amount of time, it MAY
    drop the connection and send another stimulus connection attempt
    to the primary server.</t>
    
    <t>Every CONNECT message includes a TLS-request option, and if the
    CONNECTACK message does not reject the CONNECT message and the
    TLS-reply option says TLS MUST be used, then the servers will
    immediately enter into TLS negotiation.</t>
    
    <t>Once TLS negotiation is complete, the primary server MUST
    resend the CONNECT message on the newly secured TLS connection and
    then wait for the CONNECTACK message in response.  The TLS-request
    and TLS-reply options MUST NOT appear in either this second
    CONNECT or its associated CONNECTACK message as they had in the
    first messages.</t>

    <t>The second message sent over a new connection (either a bare
    TCP connection or a connection utilizing TLS) is a STATE message.
    Upon the receipt of this message, the receiver can consider
    communications up.</t>

    <t>It is entirely possible that two servers will attempt to make
    connections to each other essentially simultaneously, and in this
    case the secondary server will be waiting for a CONNECT message on
    each connection.  The primary server MUST send a CONNECT message
    over one connection and it MUST close the other connection.</t>

    <t>A secondary server MUST NOT respond to the closing of a TCP
    connection with a blind attempt to reconnect -- there may be
    another TCP connection to the same failover partner already in
    use.</t>

  </section>

  <section title="Endpoint Identification">
    <t>The proper operation of the failover protocol requires more than
    the transmission of messages between one server and the other.  Each
    end- point might seem to be a single DHCP server, but in fact there
    are many situations where additional flexibility in configuration
    is useful.</t>

    <t>The failover protocol SHOULD be configured with one failover
    relationship between each pair of failover servers. In this case
    there is one failover endpoint for that relationship on each partner.
    This failover relationship MUST have a unique name.</t>
    
    <t>There is typically little need for addtional relationships between
    any two servers but there MAY be more than one failover relationship
    between two servers -- however each MUST have a unique relationship
    name.</t>

    <t>Any failover endpoint can take actions and hold unique states.</t>

    <t>This document frequently describes the behavior of the protocol in
    terms of primary and secondary servers, not primary and secondary
    failover endpoints.  However, it is important to remember that every
    'server' described in this document is in reality a failover endpoint
    that resides in a particular process, and that many failover
    end-points may reside in the same server process.</t>

    <t>It is not the case that there is a unique failover endpoint for
    each prefix that participates in a failover relationship.  On one
    server, there is (typically) one failover endpoint per partner,
    regardless of how many prefixes are managed by that combination of
    partner and role.  Conversely, on a particular server, any given
    prefix will be associated with exactly one failover endpoint.</t>

    <t>When a connection is received from the partner, the unique failover
    endpoint to which the message is directed is determined solely by
    the IP address of the partner, the relationship-name, and the role
    of the receiving server.</t>

</section>

<section title="Resource Allocation">
  <t>Currently there are two allocation algorithms defined for
  resources (addresses or prefixes). Additional allocation schemes
  may be defined as future extensions.</t>
  
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>Apprortioned Allocation - This allocation algorithm is a direct
    application of algorithm defined in <xref
    target="dhcpv4-failover"/> to DHCPv6. Available resources are
    split between primary and secondary server. Released resources are
    always returned to primary server.  Primary and secondary servers
    may initiate rebalancing procedure, when disparity between
    resources available to each server is detected. Only unleased
    resources are "owned" by one of the servers. This algorithm is
    particularly well suited for scenarios, where amount of available
    resources is limited. See <xref target="alloc-classic"/> for
    details.</t>
    <t>Independent Allocation - This allocation algorithm assumes that
    available resources are split between primary and secondary
    servers.  Resources are assigned to specific server all time,
    regardless if they are available or currently used. This algorithm
    is much simpler than proportional allocation, because resource
    inbanance doesn't have to be checked. There is no rebalancing for
    independent allocation. This algorithm is particularly well suited
    for scenarios, where amount of available resources is significant.
    See <xref target="alloc-separated"/> for details.</t>
  </list>

  <section anchor="alloc-classic" title="Proportional Allocation">
    <cref source='tomek'>
      Maybe we could rename it to Proportional allocation?
    </cref>

    <t>In this allocation scheme, each server has its own pool of
    available resources.  Note that a resource is not "owned" by a
    particular server throughout its entire lifetime.  Only a resource
    which is available is "owned" by a particular server -- once it
    has been leased to a client, it is not owned by either failover
    partner.  When it finally becomes available again, it will be
    owned initially by the primary server, and it may or may not be
    allocated to the secondary server by the primary server.</t>

    <t>So, the flow of a resource is as follows: initially a resource
    is owned by the primary server.  It may be allocated to the
    secondary server if it is available, and then it is owned by the
    secondary server.  Either server can allocate available resource
    which they own to clients, in which case they cease
    to own them.  When the client releases the resource or the
    lease on it expires, it will again become available and will be
    owned by the primary.</t>
    
    <t>A resource will not become owned by the server which allocated
    it initially when it is released or the lease expires because, in
    gen- eral, that server will have had to replenish its pool of
    available resources well in advance of any likely lease
    expirations.  Thus, having a particular resource cycle back to the
    secondary might well put the secondary more out of balance with
    respect to the primary instead of enhancing the balance of
    available addresses between them.</t>
    
    <t>TODO: Need to rework this v4-specific vocabulary to v6, once we
    decide how things will look like in v6.</t>
    
    <t>These address pools are used when in COMMUNICATIONS-INTERRUPTED
    state and while waiting for the MCLT expiration in PARTNER-DOWN
    state.  In addition these pools are used when in NORMAL state as
    well. This allocation and maintenance of these address pools is an
    area of some sensitivity, since the goal is to maintain a more or
    less con- stant ratio of available addresses between the two
    servers.</t>
    <t>TODO: Reuse rest of the description from section 5.4 from <xref
    target="dhcpv4-failover"/> here.</t>

  </section>
  
  <section anchor="alloc-separated" title="Independent Allocation">
    <t>In this allocation scheme, available resources are split
    between servers. Available resources are split between primary and
    secondary server as part of initial connection establishment. Once
    resources are allocated to each server, there is no need to
    reassign them.  This algorithm is simpler than proportional
    allocation due to lack of rebalancing mechanism, but it assumes
    that pool assigned to each server will never deplete. That is
    often a reasonable assumption for IPv6 addresses (e.g. servers are
    often assigned a /64 pool that many more addresses than existing
    electronic devices on Earth). This allocation mechanism SHOULD be
    used for IPv6 addresses, unless configured address pool is small
    or is otherwise administratively limited.</t>
    
    <t>Once each server is assigned a resource pool during initial
    connection establishment, it may allocate assigned resources to
    clients. Once client release a resource or its lease is expired,
    returned resource returns to pool for the same server. Resource
    never changes servers.</t>
    
    <t>During COMMUNICATION-INTERRUPTED events, a partner MAY continue
    extending existing leases when requested by clients. A healthy
    partner MUST NOT lease resources that were assigned to its downed
    partner and later released by client.

    <section anchor="time-skew" title="Time Skew">
      <t>Partners exchange information about known lease states. To
      reliably compare known lease with an update received from a
      partner, servers must be aware of time differences. Although
      simple approach would to to require both partners to use
      synchronized time, e.g. by using NTP, such service may become
      unavailable in some scenarios that failover expects to cover, e.g.
      network partition. Therefore a mechanism to measure and track
      relative time differences between servers is necessary. To do so,
      each message MUST contain FO_TIMESTAMP option that contains
      timestamp of the transmission as measured by
      transmitter. Transmitting server MUST set this as close to the
      actual transmission as possible. Receiving partner MUST store its
      own timestamp of reception event. Received timestamp information
      is then compared with local timestamp.</t>
      <t>To account for packet delay variation (jitter), measured
      difference is not used directly, but rather moving average of last
      TIME_SKEW_PKTS_AVG packets difference is calculated. This averaged
      value is referred to as time skew. Note that time skew algorithm
      allows cooperation between clients with completely desynchronized

  <section title="Proposed extensions">
    <t>The following section discusses possible extensions to proposed
    failover mechanism. Listed extensions must be sufficiently simple to
    not further complicate failover protocol. Any proposals that are
    considered complex will be defined as stand-alone extensions in
    separate documents.</t>
    
    <section title="Pseudo-Active-active mode">
      <t>A very simple way to achieve active-active mode is to remove
      the restriction that seconary server MUST NOT respond to SOLICIT
      and REQUEST messages. Instead it could respond, but MUST have
      lower preference than primary server. Clients discovering
      available servers will receive ADVERTISE messages from both
      servers, but are expected to select primary server as it has
      higher preference value configured. Following REQUEST message
      will be directed to primary servers.</t>
      <t>The benefit of this approach, compared to "basic"
      active--passive solution is that there is no delay between
      primary failure and the moment when secondary starts serving
      requests.</t>
      <t>Discussion: Possibility of setting both servers preference to
      an equal value could theoretically work as a crude attempt to
      provide load balancing. It wouldn't do much good on its own, as
      one (faster) server could be chosen more frequently (assuming
      that with equal preference sets clients will pick first
      responding server, which is not mandated by DHCPv6). We could
      design a simple mechanism of dynamically updating preference
      depending on usage of available resources. This concept haven't
      been investigated yet.</t>

  <section anchor="protocol-skeleton" title="Protocol entities">
    <t>Discussion: It is unclear if following sections belong to
    design or protocol draft. It is currently kept here as a
    scratchbook with list of things that will have to be defined
    eventually. If it will stay in this document or will be moved to
    protocol spec document is TBD.</t>
    
    <section anchor="options" title="Failover Protocol">
      <t>This section enumerates list of options that will be defined in
      failover protocol specification. Rough description of purpose and
      content for each option is specified. Exact on wire format will be
      defined in protocol specification.</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
	<t>OPTION_FO_TIMESTAMP - convey information about timestamp. It
	is used by time skew measurement algorithm (see <xref
	target="time-skew"/>).</t>
      </list></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="defines" title="Protocol constants">
      <t>This section enumerates various constants that have to be defined
      in actual protocol specification.</t>
      <t><list style="numbers">
	<t>TIME_SKEW_PKTS_AVG - number of packets that are used to calculate
	average time skew between partners. See (see <xref
	target="time-skew"/>).</t>
      </list></t>
    </section>
      
  </section>

  <section title="Open questions">
    <t>This is scratchbook. This section will be removed once questions are answered.</t>
    <t>Q: Do we want to support temporary addresses? I think not. They
    are short-lived by definition, so clients should not mind getting new temporary
    addresses.</t>
    <t>Q: Do we want to support CGA-registered addresses? There is currently
    work in DHC WG about this, but I haven't looked at it yet. If that is complicated,
    we may not define it heere, but rather as an extension.</t>
