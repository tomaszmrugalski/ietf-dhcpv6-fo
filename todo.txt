This file lists issues and tasks related to failover drafts:

Please add new number to new issues. Please move closed issues
to the list below. If this list grows significantly, we should
move to some issue tracker. IETF's DHC tracker is a reasonable
option.

 REQUIREMENTS
--------------

 DESIGN
--------
2. Reuse rest of description from failover-12, section 5.4.
3. Describe pool allocation based on percentage [Kim: is this different from #1?].
4. Describe controlled re-allocation [Kim: what is this?].
9. Describe DNS Update challenges in failover environment.
10. Describe lease reservation.
11. Write security considerations.

Q: Do we want to cover address/prefix reservation in the base
   draft or do we define an extension for it?

   Kim: I think we probably want to cover reservations in the base
   draft, but I'm out of time right now to try to write the words
   that describe this.

 PROTOCOL SPEC
---------------
- Write that thing!

 DONE
------
1. Need to rework v4-specific vocabulary to v6, in section 6.2
"Independent allocation"
5. Write conflict resolution section.
6. Describe Failover FSM initialization  
7. Since we do not support load balancing (and active-
   active) in general, CONFLICT-DONE can be removed and
   we can transition to NORMAL immediately)
  Discussed, decided not to make these changes. 8/30/12
8. Let's try to simplify the FSM a bit. We can get rid of
   PAUSE state. SHUTDOWN state can be used instead, even
   if the unavailability is only brief.
