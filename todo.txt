 REQUIREMENTS
--------------





 DESIGN
--------
1. Need to rewokr v4-specific vocabulity to v6, in section 6.2
"Independent allocation"
2. Reuse rest of description from failover-12, section 5.4.
3. Describe pool allocation based on percentage.
4. Describe controlled re-allocation.
5. Write conflict resolution section.
6. Describe Failover FSM initialization.
7. Since we do not support load balancing (and active-
   active) in general, CONFLICT-DONE can be removed and
   we can transition to NORMAL immediately)
8. Let's try to simplify the FSM a bit. We can get rid of
   PAUSE state. SHUTDOWN state can be used instead, even
   if the unavailability is only brief.
9. Describe DNS Update challenges in failover environment.
10. Describe lease reservation.
11. Write security considerations.
